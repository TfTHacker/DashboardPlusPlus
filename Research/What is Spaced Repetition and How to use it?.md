> 
Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves spacing out the repetition of learning material over time. This method of learning has been shown to be highly effective for long-term retention and recall. - _generated by GPT-3_

# What is Spaced Repetition?
Spaced repetition is a method of learning that involves gradually increasing the intervals between subsequent repetitions of learned material. This means that when you learn something new, you repeat it several times in a short period, then repeat it again after longer time gaps. The goal is to help your brain retain the information and assimilate it into your long-term memory.
 
# How Does Spaced Repetition Work?
The concept behind spaced repetition works on the principle that our brains remember things better when we recall them more frequently. 
 
When we learn something new, our brains encode it in our short-term memory. However, if we don't revisit the information, it will fade away from our memory quickly.
 
By spacing out the repetition of learned material, we can move this information from our short-term memory to our long-term memory. Over time, the brain strengthens neural connections associated with the learned material.

# How to Use Spaced Repetition Effectively?
To use spaced repetition effectively, you need to make flashcards with important information or concepts. Flashcards are ideal because they are easy to carry around and review on-the-go.
 
# Steps to follow when using spaced repetition:
## Step 1: Create Flashcards
Create flashcards with questions or concepts on one side and answers on the other side. You can use online tools like Anki or Quizlet to create digital flashcards.
 
## Step 2: Review Flashcards Daily
Review your flashcards daily and test yourself on each card until you can recall all the information correctly.
 
## Step 3: Space Out Your Reviews
After reviewing your flashcards for a few days, start spacing out your reviews. Review the cards you struggled with the next day and then again in two days. After that, review them after a week, then two weeks, and so on. 

## Step 4: Focus on Difficult Cards
Focus more on the flashcards you struggle with and less on the ones you find easy. This will help you spend more time reinforcing the information that needs to be strengthened.
